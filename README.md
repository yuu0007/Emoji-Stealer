# This project is no longer in development and the bot has been shut down.

## Getting Started

[Emoji Stealer] is a Discord Bot that allows it's users to copy custom emojis from other guilds. Without downloads.

To use this bot, you must host it yourself.

Useful reading: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot

## Installation

Assuming you already have [Node.js] installed, install the required packages:

> Please use the latest version on Node.js, as this project is constantly keeping up to date.
> Emoji Stealer is built and tested with the latest version of Node.js

This project uses [yarn].

If you do not have yarn installed you can install it from their website or via npm: `npm install -g yarn`

In the project folder, run `yarn install`

##### Potential issues during installation

On linux you may need additional dependencies (on ubuntu: `automake`) for the image compression packages imagemin and addons. Not individually installing the [`imagemin`] packages (only with npm, **yarn does not have this issue**) has lead to errors on Ubuntu, see this [issue](https://github.com/TMUniversal/Emoji-Stealer/issues/31#issuecomment-664607038).

## Setup

- Make a copy of [`data.example.json`], name it `data.json`.
- Fill in the necessary values.
  - `owners` may be an array of strings

```JS
  {
    "clientToken": "<Discord Bot Token>",
    "webhook": { // The bot will send logs to this discord webhook.
      "id": "",
      "secret": ""
    },
    "weebToken": "<Token>",  // Closed API. Request key (more info on website) or leave empty
    "dblToken": "<Another token>", // Your top.gg api key. Used to upload stats.
    "prefix": ">",
    "owners": "<Your Discord ID>",
    "userBlacklist": ["<some id>"], // users that cannot use commands
    "counter": { // persisting counters with countapi.xyz (may need manual creation). This counts the amount of emojis and profile pictures the bot has successfully uploaded.
      "namespace": "",
      "emojiKey": "",
      "pfpKey": ""
    }
  }
```

## Starting

To start the bot, the code must first be complied.

- Run `yarn build`
- You may then start with `yarn start` or, if you have pm2 installed: `pm2 start pm2-start.json`
- Alternatively: Run `yarn run cs` to build and then start.
- This bot can easily be started with docker: `./scripts/docker.sh build`; `./scripts/docker.sh help` for more information.

## Updating

To automatically get the latest updates and rebuild the code, use the update script: `./scripts/update.sh`

Warning: The script will reset your local repository.

After pulling the latest code (on your current branch), the script will re-build the source code.

You have to restart your application, the script will not do that for you.

## Using the bot
